# pubconf.io
Website for PubConf Events.

## Developer Setup

This is a Jekyll static site hosted on GitHub Pages. The distributed files are hosted on the `main` branch.

### Dependencies

1. Install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/). Include on `path`.
2. Install [Ruby Dev Kit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit)
3. `gem install jekyll`
4. `gem install bundle`
5. `bundle install`

## Run It Locally
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Structure

Content is based on YAML data files in the `_data` directory.

## Creating and Managing Your Event

If you are hosting a PubConf event, and have already chatted with the PubConf team, you are welcome to submit a PR with changes and details for your event. If you have not chatted with the PubConf team yet, start there. Email `hello@pubconf.io`

Each PubConf event is defined as a file in the `_events` collection. There is a template there defining the structure.

PubConf speakers are defined as a file in the `_speakers` collection. This allows speakers to maintain a profile between events and reduce data collection work. Events and Speakers cross-reference by the `speaker.slug`.

In general, you shouldn't need to make changes to templates or CSS files.

### Voting

You can handle speaker voting through this website by visiting `https://pubconf.io/vote/?event={{ YOUR EVENT ID }}&hash={{ SOME VALUE }}` where `{{ YOUR EVENT ID}}` is the url slug, like "amsterdam" or "nottingham" and `{{ SOME VALUE }}` is any hash key that you keep secret until voting time. For example:

https://pubconf.io/vote/?event=amsterdam&hash=toddrules

This will render a voting form for the next `amsterdam` event, secured by the key `toddrules`.

To see the results of the vote, visit `https://pubconf.io/vote/results/?event={{ YOUR EVENT ID }}&hash={{ SOME VALUE }}`. This will render the vote tally for the event, made with the secret hash key, in the last 30 minutes. The hash key and the time limit are the only security precautions here.

Do not share the results URL with the audience. Keeping it to the host allows you to correct for suspected fraud and make tie-breaker decisions.
