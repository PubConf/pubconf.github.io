      PubConf is a developer variety show that combines a social conference
      afterparty with funny and inspiring talks from some of the worldâ€™s best
      speakers. The relaxed context and lighthearted content inspire an intimate
      atmosphere for conversations and new ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      We believe that sponsors are a key part of the event, not an add-on. Sponsors
      are worked into the opening monologue and speaker presentations to create
      a powerful and unique placement for your brand. You'll also get complementary
      tickets amd representation on event materials.

      The way sponsors were included in the presentations throughout the night was perfect.
      So much better than just having our logo on the opening slide.<br />

        PubConf does not profit from our events. We will use all sponsorship and
        attendance money to secure the venue, food, and drink during the event,
        as well as providing a small gift to our speakers.
